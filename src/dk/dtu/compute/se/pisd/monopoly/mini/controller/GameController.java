/**
 * The overall controller of a Monopoly game. It provides access
 * to all basic actions and activities for the game. All other
 * activities of the game, should be implemented by referring
 * to the basic actions and activities in this class.
 * 
 * Note that this controller is far from being finished and many
 * things could be done in a much nicer and cleaner way! But, it
 * shows the general idea of how the model, view (GUI), and the
 * controller could work with each other, and how different parts
 * of the game's activities can be separated from each other, so
 * that different parts can be added and extended independently
 * from each other.
 * 
 * For fully implementing the game, it will probably be necessary
 * to add more of these basic actions in this class.
 * 
 * The <code>doAction()</code> methods of the
 * {@link dk.dtu.compute.se.pisd.monopoly.mini.model.Space} and
 * the {@link dk.dtu.compute.se.pisd.monopoly.mini.model.Card}
 * can be implemented based on the basic actions and activities
 * of this game controller.
